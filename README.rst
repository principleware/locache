Important Note
--------------

This repository has been inactive for quite a while. We are using it to build
memory cache. Some versions break up in Angular 2/4/5, because of *_defer* method.

locache
-------

JavaScript framework for client side caching in the browser using DOM
Storage with expiring values. With a memcache inspired API usage is
very simple. Locache has no dependencies and is very small.

locache gracefully degrades when the browser doesn't support localStorage.
Usually this will be IE6 or IE7, you wont get any errors, but caching
attempts will be silently dropped and lookups will always appear to be a
cache miss.




When and why?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Locache.js isn't a replacement for cache headers, and won't replace real
server side caching. However, locache can be used to help speed up pages
By caching results from APIs that you can't control or by caching complex
structures created in JavaScript to avoid recreating. This works well with
Models in backbone or rendered templates for example.


Setting, getting and removing values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Values can be stored one at a time as shown below, these values will never
expire and will only be removed when you (or the browser) removes them.

::

    locache.set("my_key", "my_value")

    locache.get("my_key")
    // my_value

    locache.remove("my_key")

When you store an object, that's what you'll get back. For example, a number:

::

    locache.set("counter", 1)
    typeof locache.get("counter")
    // number



Storing complex objects isn't a problem too. Just make sure they are JSON
serializable.

::

    locache.set('user', {
        'name': "Dougal Matthews",
        'alias': d0ugal
    })

    var result = locache.get('user')

    //{
    //    'name': "Dougal Matthews",
    //    'alias': d0ugal
    //}


You can also perform batch operations.

::

    locache.setMany({
        'name': 'locache',
        'language': 'JavaScript'
    })

    locache.getMany(['name', 'language'])
    // ['locache', 'JavaScript']

    locache.removeMany(['name', 'language'])


Setting values that expire
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    seconds = 5;
    locache.set("key", "value", seconds);

    // After 5 seconds this will return null.
    locache.get("key");


Incrementing and decrementing? Sure.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

    locache.incr("counter")
    // 1
    locache.incr("counter")
    // 2
    locache.decr("counter")
    // 1
    locache.decr("counter")
    // 0
    locache.decr("counter")
    // -1


Flushing the cache
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the following to clear only the locache values stored in localStorage.

::

    locache.flush()


Performing cleanup
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Since localStorage doesn't support expiring values, they will still be left
around. This may or may not be a problem for you. If you want to make sure
they are cleaned up, use the following method on page load, or with a
setTimeout loop.

::

    locache.cleanup()
